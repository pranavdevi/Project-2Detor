A person has a genetic deficiency or disorder due to some mutation or deletion of a particular amino acid in a gene sequence.
Example ADA deficiency in a person. This enzyme is crucial for the immune system to function.The disorder is caused due to the 
deletion of the gene for adenosine deaminase. In some children ADA deficiency can be cured by bone marrow transplantation; in others 
it can be treated by enzyme replacement therapy, in which functional ADA is given to the patient by injection. But the problem with 
both of these approaches that they are not completely curative. As a first step towards gene therapy,lymphocytes from the blood of 
the patient are grown in a culture outside the body. A functional ADA cDNA (using a retroviral vector) is then introduced into these 
lymphocytes, which are subsequently returned to the patient. However, as these cells are not immortal, the patient requires
periodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes. However, if the gene isolate from marrow cells producing ADA is 
introduced into cells at early embryonic stages, it could be a permanent cure. 

A single stranded DNA or RNA, tagged with a radioactive molecule(probe) is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone 
of cells followed by detection using autoradiography. The clone having the mutated gene will hence not appear on the photographic 
film, because the probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene.

Therefore, the program will contain the codon-amino acid table. When the 

Input:
	Patient's gene sequence (at embryonic stage)
Process: 
	comparing patient's gene sequence against program-generated template sequence 	
	==> Mutation is present if Sp!=St
	
Output:
	==>Mutated gene (substring)
	==>pos of mutated gene
	==>Confirmation of disorder.
